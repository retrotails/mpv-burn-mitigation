# mpv-burn-mitigation
![demo](/demo.gif?raw=true)  
Slowly pans content that doesn't match your aspect ratio to reduce burn-in for displays such as CRT, OLED and plasma.  
Defaults to 1 complete up/down motion per 2 hours  
Can pan any source aspect ratio to any display aspect ratio.  
Example gif is ultra-wide content on a 16:9 monitor, sped up 1200x.  
Also works with, for example, 4:3 content panning left/right on a 16:9 display.  
## Usage:
Place burn-mitigation.lua in ~/.config/mpv/scripts/
## TODO:
Remember screen offset, so files don't always start in the middle
